# Linear algebra task
## This is solver application for easer cheking answers in task with substitutions

### Example of task
#### Given:
Substitution order 4:
a<sub>12</sub>a<sub>2p</sub>a<sub>r3</sub>a<sub>3s</sub>

#### Asks:
How many variants off (p, r, s) exists to make this substitution be positive in fotmula of determinante order 4?

### Current issues
+ Program works properly only in situations when same variable can not exist in both higher and lower permutation 
+ Program works properly only with substitution order less 10
+ There is no check for input values, so run it carefully
+ Input going from incoded constansts
